// The frontend has a registration page with fields for name, username, email, password, and confirm password.
// The login page includes email and password fields.
// The backend uses Express.js for routing and handling requests.
// MongoDB and Mongoose manage the database of users.
// CORS middleware allows cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend.
// bcrypt is used to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.
// During registration, bcrypt.genSalt and bcrypt.hash are used to hash the user's password.
// User data is saved to MongoDB after successful hashing.
// For login, bcrypt.compare checks the provided password against the hashed password in the database



// ðŸš€ Just wrapped up a project integrating secure user registration and login for my web app! Frontend features registration and login forms, while the backend uses Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose for seamless data handling. Implemented bcrypt for secure password hashing and comparison. Ensuring secure and efficient user authentication has been an exciting challenge! #WebDevelopment #NodeJS #MongoDB #Security #CodingLife

// ðŸŽ‰ Excited to share my latest project: a secure user registration and login system! Frontend includes user-friendly forms, while the backend leverages Express.js, MongoDB, and bcrypt for top-notch security. Passwords are securely hashed and compared, ensuring robust authentication. Loving the challenge and growth in my coding journey! #WebDev #FullStack #CyberSecurity #MongoDB #TechInnovation
